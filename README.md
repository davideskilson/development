# Development

## Deployed App

Here is a link to my deployed React app, running on Vercel: [Link](https://development-black.vercel.app/)

## Instructions for Locally Running

(Citation: these instructions are heavily based those in the default React `README`)\
In the `my-app/` directory, you can run:

```sh
  npm start
```

This runs the app in the development mode.\
You can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Additionally, you can press ctrl + C in order to stop running locally.

## Known Bugs

None at the moment.
